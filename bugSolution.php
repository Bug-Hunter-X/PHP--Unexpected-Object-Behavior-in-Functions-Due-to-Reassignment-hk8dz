The solution avoids reassigning the object within the function. Instead, it directly modifies the properties of the passed object:

```php
class MyClass {
    public $value = 0;
}

function modifyObject(MyClass &$obj) {
    $obj->value = 10; // Modifies the original object
}

$myObject = new MyClass();
modifyObject($myObject);
echo $myObject->value; // Outputs 10
```

Alternatively, using the ampersand (&) before `$obj` in the function parameter makes the parameter passed by reference. Now the changes within the function are reflected outside of the function.  This is generally the preferred and more efficient solution.

Note the critical difference.  By modifying the object's property instead of reassigning the object itself, the changes are reflected in the original object. This corrected behavior is demonstrated in `bugSolution.php`.
